DO NOT EDIT FILES IN ESPHOME-release
------------------------------------
This repository's ESPHOME-release directory is auto-generated by the release scripts.
Any changes made directly inside ESPHOME-release will be overwritten on the next run.

Make your changes in the source locations:
- ESPHome component sources: ESPHOME/components/everblu_meter/
- Shared code used by the component: src/

Then regenerate the release package:
- Windows PowerShell: pwsh ESPHOME/prepare-component-release.ps1
- Linux/macOS: bash ESPHOME/prepare-component-release.sh

Note for AI assistants and collaborators:
- Treat ESPHOME-release as build output. Do not modify files there.
- Update sources under ESPHOME/components/everblu_meter and src/ instead.

Rationale:
- The release process copies and flattens sources for distribution.
- Edits in ESPHOME-release are ephemeral and will be lost.
