# Breaking Changes - v3.1.0

This release includes integration-level breaking changes for ESPHome and MQTT scan naming/behavior.

## ESPHome Configuration Migration

Update scan button keys in YAML:

- `frequency_scan_button` -> `deep_scan_button`
- `wide_frequency_scan_button` -> `deep_scan_button`
- `fast_scan_button` -> removed (no direct replacement)

Notes:

- `auto_scan` default changed to `false` (startup deep scan is now opt-in).
- `auto_scan_on_failure` remains available for recovery scans after repeated failures.

## MQTT Topic/Automation Migration

Update scan command topic references:

- `freq_scan` -> `deep_scan`
- `fast_scan` -> removed

If Home Assistant automations or scripts reference old entities/topics, update them to the `deep_scan` equivalents.

## Why This Is Breaking

Existing YAML keys and MQTT topic names used by prior versions will no longer trigger scan actions unless migrated.

## Quick Checklist

1. Replace old ESPHome scan button keys with `deep_scan_button`.
2. Replace MQTT `freq_scan` usage with `deep_scan`.
3. Remove any `fast_scan` references.
4. Decide whether to explicitly set `auto_scan: true` for startup behavior matching older installs.

## Release Summary For Reviewers (v3.1.0)

### What Is Changing

- Bumps release version metadata to `3.1.0`.
- Finalizes release notes in `CHANGELOG.md` for the `develop -> main` delta.
- Adds explicit AI-oriented release metadata blocks to improve future tooling/auditability.
- Audits branch history so changelog coverage includes merged work and superseded iterations.
- Enriches historical major/minor release metadata on `main` using PR-description context.

### Main Behavior And Feature Changes Called Out In This Release

- Frequency calibration/scanning improvements:
	- Two-phase Deep scan behavior and quality guard hardening.
	- Optional `AUTO_SCAN_ON_FAILURE_ENABLED` flow with immediate retry after successful retune.
	- Default startup auto-scan disabled (`AUTO_SCAN_ENABLED`/`auto_scan` -> false).
	- CC1101 RX bandwidth widened (58 kHz -> 270 kHz) with related FOC changes.
- MQTT/telemetry updates:
	- Reset Frequency Offset button/topic in standalone MQTT.
	- `tuned_frequency` and `frequency_estimate` sensors discovery + publishing fixes.
	- Timestamped tagged serial log lines.
- Decoder/data quality:
	- RADIAN decoder deduplication to shared implementation.
	- Reading plausibility guard vs history.
	- LQI/CRC-bit handling and percentage mapping fixes.
- RF/runtime hardening:
	- Near-field saturation detection warning.
	- RX mode timeout/recovery in CC1101 state handling.
	- AGC profile rebalance and attenuation options.
- History payload correction:
	- `monthly_usage` omits oldest month lacking prior delta baseline.

### ESPHome Config Validation And Tests

- New config-time validators in the `everblu_meter` component (fail fast during `esphome config` instead of a later C++ compile error or a silent runtime fallback):
	- **ESP32 Arduino framework required**: rejects an ESP32 target that is not using `framework: type: arduino` with a clear "requires ESP32 Arduino framework" message (the component depends on Arduino headers). ESP8266 is unaffected.
	- **GDO0/GDO2 pin conflict**: rejects `gdo0_pin` and `gdo2_pin` set to the same GPIO.
	- **`reading_schedule` validated and case-insensitive**: previously accepted any string and silently fell back to `Monday-Friday`; now validated against the known presets/weekdays and normalised for case (e.g. `monday-friday` -> `Monday-Friday`).
- New test coverage for all component config validators:
	- Negative `esphome config` fixtures (`.ci/esphome/everblu_meter/test.invalid-*.yaml`) that must be rejected.
	- Python unit tests (`tests/esphome/test_validators.py`, 27 cases) calling the validators directly.
	- New CI jobs `negative-validation` and `python-unit-tests` in the ESPHome external-component workflow.

### CI/Tooling: ESPHOME-release Auto-Sync On pre-commit.ci

- **New `esphome-release-sync` pre-commit hook** (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`): re-runs `ESPHOME/prepare-component-release.sh` whenever `src/`, `ESPHOME/components/everblu_meter/`, or the release script changes. Because pre-commit.ci autofix hooks (`ruff`, `clang-format`) rewrite source files, the generated `ESPHOME-release/` tree could drift out of sync and fail the "ESPHOME Sync Check" job. The new hook makes pre-commit.ci regenerate and commit `ESPHOME-release/` alongside its autofixes, keeping the check green. Verified in the cloud: pre-commit.ci's autofix commit on PR #125 regenerated `ESPHOME-release/everblu_meter/__init__.py`, which also corrected a pre-existing formatting drift (a missing blank line vs. its source).

### Note On Superseded Work

- Earlier manual wide-scan UX/topic naming work is superseded by final Deep-scan naming/behavior documented in the changelog.

### Post-Review Bug Fixes (PR #125 Copilot Review)

Four bugs identified during the Copilot review of this PR were fixed before merge:

- **`AUTO_SCAN_ON_FAILURE_ENABLED` default mismatch**: `isAutoScanOnFailureEnabled()` in `define_config_provider.h` returned `true` by default when the macro was not defined, contradicting `private.example.h` which documents the default as `0` (disabled). Fixed to return `false`.
- **Boot-uptime timestamp showed `[boot+0s]`**: `everblu_log_timestamp()` used `time()` for the pre-NTP branch, which returns 0 before the clock is set. Fixed to use `millis()/1000` (actual seconds since reset); static buffer enlarged from 16 to 20 bytes to prevent truncation.
- **Deep scan quality guard treated 0.0 kHz calibration as "no prior calibration"**: the guard used `previousOffset == 0.0f` to bypass quality comparison, but `begin()` assigns `s_storedOffset = 0.0f` for both "nothing saved" and "saved value is 0.0". A `s_hasStoredCalibration` flag (set by `begin()` and `saveFrequencyOffset()`) is now used instead.
- **Serial history table month labels off by one**: `printToSerial()` labelled the oldest entry as `-13` when `monthCount=13`. Formula changed from `monthCount − i` to `monthCount − 1 − i`, consistent with `getMonthLabel()`.

### Test Coverage Improvements (PR #125)

Codecov coverage now tracks three platform-neutral core files (`crc_kermit.cpp`, `radian_parser.cpp`, `radian_decoder.cpp`). New native unit tests raise patch and project coverage by exercising previously-missed branches:

- **`radian_decode_4bitpbit()`**: single-sample glitch recovery, decoded-buffer truncation, framing-error rejection, framing-error-during-truncation, and no-transition input.
- **`radian_validate_crc()`**: valid/corrupt CRC, NULL, undersized, short/long length-field, and implicit-length (`length_field == 0`) frames — previously only covered indirectly via optional captured fixtures.
- **`radian_parse_primary_data()`**: `out == NULL`, `decoded == NULL`, `size < 30`, battery/counter `0xFF` sentinels, and the `30 <= size < 49` path.

The only remaining uncovered lines are genuinely defensive: an unreachable bounds guard (both byte-increment sites already return when the buffer fills) and the `framing_errors < 255` saturation branch (needs 255+ framing errors in one frame).
