1. PRESENTATION
The C yble RF i s a c ompact radio m odule d esigned for r eading w ater m eters.
The Cyble RF 4 33 M Hz complies w ith current
radio f requency regulations in France and
meets t he requirements of m arket p layers
(local a uthorities, service companies, p rivate
distributors) w ho w ish t o develop radio
frequency r emote reading o f water meters
to i mprove their p roductivity and offer n ew
services to t heir c ustomers.
INSTALLATION F LEXIBILITY
The C yble R F i s placed d irectly on the m eter. T he concept o f a c ompact r adio m odule makes
installation e asier b ecause it a voids a ny wiring and w all mounting.
The C yble R F i s compatible w ith the entire r ange o f Actaris w ater m eters pre-equipped w ith t he
target n eedle (from DN 1 5 to D N 500).
The C yble R F c an b e delivered f rom the f actory, already installed on the m eter a nd p rogrammed t o save
time during c ommissioning. Commissioning is then l imited to installation o n the p ipe.
The C yble R F, alone, can b e fitted t o m eters a lready installed without r equiring a ny change, removal
or unsealing o f t he meter.
The C yble R F c an b e read b y any R ADIAN type radio equipment : portable d rive-by o r f ixed network d ata
entry t erminal.

RELIABILITY
The C yble R F r emotely transmits t he c urrent volume i ndex in full accordance with t he m echanical i ndex o f t he water m eter. T he
Cyble t echnology, o n which the C yble R F is b ased, e liminates any p arasitic p ulse, c ounts w ater r egardless of t he f low d irection a nd
takes i nto account a ny w ater returns. T he Cyble t echnology, patented b y A ctaris, has p roven its r eliability s ince 1 996, o n several
million meters
The t arget, m ade o f a non-magnetic material a nd p resent as s tandard o n the t otalizer o f t he e ntire range o f Actaris w ater m eters,
as w ell as t he C yble R F detection s ystem are insensitive to attempts at fraud by m agnet.
Encapsulating t he e lectronics i n a w aterproof r esin p rotects t he C yble RF f rom the p rolonged e ffects of w ater immersion (IP68).
The C yble R F's housing is designed t o b e s hock and U V resistant.
The C yble R F h as a typical l ifespan of 1 5 y ears u nder s tandard u se.
The C yble R F h as b een designed to w ithstand r esidential, commercial and i ndustrial environments . I t can b e i nstalled both in a
face and i n a technical d uct.
MULTIFUNCTIONS
The t arget t echnology h as m ade i t possible t o i ntegrate numerous i ntelligent functions w hich constitute as m uch a dded value c ompared
to a summary i ndex reading: - monthly r eadings of t he w ater m eter i ndex
over 13 m onths, - detection and h istory of l eaks o ver 1 3 m onths, - detection,
history o ver 1 3 months and q uantification of r everse f lows i n
the pipeline, - i ndication o f end o f b attery l ife, - detection o f t emporary or permanent f raud a ttempts, - alarms, etc.
These functions a llow the C yble R F to m eet t he n eeds o f: - billing or distribution, -
control a nd m aintenance o f t he meter

2. TECHNICAL CHARACTERISTICS
2.1INTRODUCTION
ÿ
The Cyble R F is a radio i nterface for Actaris water m eters pre-equipped w ith a target.
It is a n i ntelligent i nterface t hat counts t he target r evolutions ( one r evolution corresponds t o
an i ncrement o n t he l ast roller of the totalizer a nd therefore to the pulse w eight o f t he counter)
and p rovides i ndexes, flags ( event indicators), a larms and information p rocessed by radio
link via a ny RADIAN c ompatible equipment.

Filtering o f s purious i mpulses Cyble t echnology does not, b y d esign, a llow p arasitic pulses b y bouncing
or v ibration, u nlike REED t echnology.
End o f l ife i ndication An a larm i ndicates t he battery l ife status.
This alarm i s triggered 1 y ear b efore the m inimum theoretical e nd o f life (12
years) of t he battery.
A counter a lso i ndicates t he remaining b attery l ife, e xpressed i n m onths.
Current index The i nitialization or r esetting of the i ndex is possible on site. The index p rovided by the
ÿ
Cyble R F takes i nto a ccount a ny w ater r eturns, and i s therefore in l ine with t he mechanical
index o f the totalizer.
The i ndex is p rovided on 8 d igits (99999999).
The index changes from 00000000 to 99999999 when decremented.
Date a nd time Date a nd time a re a vailable and t ake i nto a ccount l eap y ears u ntil 2 100.
Date and t ime can b e set o n site.
Monthly a rchiving o f i ndexes The current index is automatically a rchived on t he l ast day o f the month - e very m onth
- and kept i n m emory for 13 c onsecutive rolling months.
Leak d etection A l eak detection t hreshold i s a vailable a nd can b e c onfigured o n s ite o r in the f actory.
It generates a d aily flag ( =event i ndicator) (at midnight) w hen Q moy > threshold d uring
the entire past d ay.
In addition, the n umber of days per m onth during which a l eak above t he threshold w as
detected is stored. A h istory o ver 1 3 c onsecutive rolling months is kept i n memory.
Reverse f low The cumulative volume index i n case of r everse f low i s available, f rom the first target
needle turn (=pulse w eight).
This index can b e r eset during an o n-site i ntervention.
In addition, if a r everse f low g reater than 10 target n eedle turns is detected a t least once
in t he month, a m onthly a larm is t riggered. T his i nformation i s archived over 1 3 consecutive
rolling months.
Fraud d etection Any attempt at uprising o r w ithdrawal, t emporary o r p ermanent,
ÿ
of the Cyble RF m odule is d etected (fraud check every 1 s ec) a nd t riggers a n a larm
(temporary fraud/permanent f raud).
This alarm c an b e reset during an o n-site i ntervention.

The g eometry o f the m echanical interface between the C yble R F and the
totalizer p rohibits a ny a ttempt to i nsert a foreign b ody.
Alarms Available alarms: - b attery
life less t han 1 y ear - a ttempted fraud (temporary o r
permanent) - t ransmission problem between the meter and t he
RF module - r everse f low - l eaks
Note: T he functions r elating to under-volume counts ( = consumption too l ow), e xcessive
volumes (= c onsumption too h igh) and counting interruptions ( = zero c onsumption)
are integrated into t he A ctaris e mbedded r eading software s upplied with the A ctaris
portable data e ntry terminals. These functions a re part o f the “ Consumption control”
automatically implemented during r eading.
