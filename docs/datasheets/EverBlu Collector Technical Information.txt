2. EverBlu Collector Technical Information
2.1. EverBlu Collector principle
EverBlu Collector extends the coverage of the concentrators allowing them to achieve higher ranges.
Its main purpose is to receive and store the information coming from the allocated EverBlu MIUs and
send this information to the EverBlu Access Point

2.3. Radio Frequency Features
Conformity CE marking (in accordance with the R&TTE directive)
MFD (RADIAN user group) (433MHz)
Protocol
Proprietary (921MHz)
Modulation Frequency Shift Keying
Frequency carrier 433.82 MHz / 921 MHz
Transmission Symmetrical 2-way communication
none for 433MHz (master)
Wake-up period
every 4 seconds for 921
2.3.1. Modulation & Frequency band
Frequency band = 433.82 MHz
Compared to the usual 433.92 MHz (car doors, toys, garage gates...), our frequency is slightly shifted
in order to avoid RF noises in congested areas.
Modulation = Frequency Shift Keying (= frequency modulation)
Transmission = symmetrical 2-way (= the EverBlu Cyble is both a receiver and an emitter)
Radiated power < 10mW (in compliance with the European regulation)
Frequency band = 921MHz
Modulation = Frequency Shift Keying (= frequency modulation)
Transmission = symmetrical 2-way (= the EverBlu Access Point.is both a receiver and an emitter)
Radiated power ≈ 200mW (in compliance with the European regulation)
2.3.2. Protocol
For frequency band = 433MHz
Same specifications as for the EverBly Cyble
For frequency band = 921Mhz
This protocol is proprietary.
Communication speed = 38400 bauds
2.3.3. Wake up profile
In order to save power consumption, the RF receiver does not remain ON all the time long.
It is then woken up for a short duration (10 ms), every given period (4 seconds).
This period is then the maximum time duration that the reader will have to wait until the Cyble RF is able to answer.

2.4.5. Reading Distances
Reading distance mainly depends on the environment and on the reading system.
We highly recommend that a trial should be carried out with the customer using the EverBlu
Site Survey Tools in order to find out the real reading distance in your customer's sites.
